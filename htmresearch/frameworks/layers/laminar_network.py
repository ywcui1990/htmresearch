"""
Overall factory methods to create networks of multiple layers and for
experimenting with different laminar structures.

There are two main types of networks:

  L2L4 networks, and,
  L2456 networks.

Either type can be created as a single column or with multiple columns. Each
type has its own creation file (imported here) - see that file for detailed
descriptions.
